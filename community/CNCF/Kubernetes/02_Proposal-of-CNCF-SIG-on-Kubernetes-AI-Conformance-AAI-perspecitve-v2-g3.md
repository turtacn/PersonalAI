**A Proposal for Enterprise-Grade Kubernetes Conformance for Agentic AI Platforms**

**Version**: 0.9 (Draft)

**Author**: CNCF SIG-AI (Contributors: [turtacn/Organization Here])

**Date**: August 24, 2025

## **Abstract**

As Agentic AI transitions from experimentation to production, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for hosting its complex workloads. However, running AI applications on standard Kubernetes, especially in enterprise environments that demand high performance, strong security, and portability, still faces significant challenges due to a lack of standardization, complex configuration, and inconsistent capabilities. This white paper proposes a new, AI-focused add-on certification: **Kubernetes AI Conformance**. Building upon the existing CNCF Kubernetes Conformance, it aims to define a standardized set of capabilities and testing benchmarks covering hardware resource management, AI workload scheduling, networking, storage, security, and observability. This will ensure seamless migration of AI applications across different certified platforms, accelerating the adoption and innovation of enterprise-grade Agentic AI.

## **1. Background and Core Problems**

[cite\_start]Running AI workloads on Kubernetes currently suffers from three main pain points: **a lack of standardization, poor portability, and complex configuration**[cite: 61].

  * **Lack of Standardization**: How does one describe and schedule a training job that requires a specific GPU topology? How can a unified, traffic-splitting-capable API entry point be provided for inference services? These questions currently lack uniform, declarative solutions.
  * **Poor Portability**: An AI application developed on a highly optimized Kubernetes cluster from one cloud vendor is often difficult to migrate directly to another cloud or on-premise environment because it heavily relies on specific device plugins, storage drivers, and network configurations.
  * **Complex Configuration**: Users need to perform extensive "DIY" work, manually assembling schedulers, device plugins, monitoring tools, and more to build a functional AI platform. This significantly increases the total cost of ownership (TCO) and slows down the pace of innovation.

## **2. Core Principles and Goals**

The Kubernetes AI Conformance follows these core principles:

  * **Based on Open Standards**: All specifications prioritize existing or emerging standards from the CNCF and Kubernetes communities (e.g., DRA, Gateway API, JobSet).
  * **Declarative and Automated**: Emphasizes the use of declarative APIs to define and manage AI infrastructure and workloads, and encourages automated testing.
  * **Layered and Decoupled**: The specification defines the "capabilities" a platform must have, not the specific "implementation," encouraging ecosystem diversity.
  * **Enterprise-Ready**: A strong focus on security, reliability, observability, and governance to meet the stringent requirements of production enterprise environments.

**Core Goals**:

1.  [cite\_start]**To provide users with an "out-of-the-box," AI-optimized Kubernetes environment**, lowering the barrier to entry[cite: 62].
2.  [cite\_start]**To guarantee the portability of AI workloads**, enabling seamless migration across any certified platform[cite: 62].
3.  [cite\_start]**To foster a healthy AI infrastructure ecosystem** by providing a stable and reliable foundation for higher-level AI frameworks and service providers[cite: 62].

## **3. Conformance Specification and Test Domains (Draft)**

A platform certified for Kubernetes AI Conformance MUST or SHOULD meet specific requirements in the following domains.

### **3.1. Hardware and Resource Management**

  * [cite\_start]**[MUST] Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)**: The platform must use the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) API from Kubernetes v1.34+ to manage and expose AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs/FPGAs) and other specialized hardware[cite: 61, 65]. This replaces the old Device Plugin model and is the cornerstone of topology-aware scheduling.
  * **[MUST] Core Performance Metrics Exposure**: The platform must expose a core set of accelerator performance metrics via a standard metrics endpoint (e.g., in Prometheus format). [cite\_start]The baseline requirement includes at least **per-accelerator utilization** and **memory usage**[cite: 62].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Automated Fault Detection**: The platform should have the capability to automatically detect hardware failures (e.g., an offline GPU) and automatically cordon and drain the affected nodes to improve overall cluster availability[cite: 78].

### **3.2. Workload Definition and Scheduling**

  * [cite\_start]**[MUST] AI-Native Workload CRD Support**: The platform must support standardized CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) for defining Agentic AI-related workloads, such as an `AgentTool` CRD for automatic tool registration and discovery[cite: 21].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Distributed Job Management (JobSet)**: The platform should support the `JobSet` API for managing tightly coupled distributed training jobs, ensuring their "All-or-Nothing" atomic execution[cite: 63, 73].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Job Queuing and Resource Sharing (Kueue)**: The platform should integrate `Kueue` to provide queuing, preemption, fair sharing, and resource reservation for batch jobs, thereby improving resource utilization[cite: 63, 71].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Topology and NUMA-Aware Scheduling**: The scheduler should be able to understand the hardware topology (e.g., NVLink connections between GPUs, NUMA relationship between CPUs and GPUs) and perform affinity-based scheduling to minimize data transfer latency[cite: 55, 68].

### **3.3. Networking**

  * [cite\_start]**[MUST] Inference Service Traffic Management (Gateway API)**: The platform must use the `Gateway API` as the standard entry point for managing traffic to AI inference services, supporting advanced features like traffic splitting and header-based routing[cite: 65, 74].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] High-Performance Multi-NIC Support**: The platform should support attaching multiple network interfaces to a Pod (e.g., via Multus CNI) and be able to expose high-performance NICs (e.g., supporting RDMA/SR-IOV) through DRA, enabling co-scheduling of compute and communication networks[cite: 68].

### **3.4. Storage**

  * [cite\_start]**[MUST] Container Storage Interface (CSI)**: The platform must use `CSI` to interface with storage systems, supporting features like dynamic volume provisioning and snapshots[cite: 64, 71].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] High-Performance Storage Support**: The platform should be able to integrate with high-performance storage that supports direct GPU access (e.g., GPUDirect Storage) to accelerate data-intensive tasks[cite: 41].

### **3.5. Security and Isolation**

  * [cite\_start]**[MUST] Runtime Security Policies**: The platform must support standard Network Policies and be able to control egress traffic from agents[cite: 55, 76].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Workload Identity**: The platform should support a workload identity mechanism based on standards like SPIFFE/SPIRE to provide a foundation for zero-trust security and fine-grained access control[cite: 64, 67, 75].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Workload Sandboxing**: The platform should offer at least one strongly isolated sandbox runtime (e.g., gVisor, Kata Containers) for executing untrusted agent code, selectable declaratively via `RuntimeClass`[cite: 56, 67, 76].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Confidential Computing**: For the highest level of security, the platform should support running workloads in confidential computing environments (e.g., Intel TDX, AMD SEV) to protect data in use[cite: 67].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] Software Supply Chain Security**: The platform should integrate with tools like Sigstore/Cosign to enforce image signature verification policies, ensuring the provenance of deployed AI models and applications[cite: 64].

### **3.6. Observability**

  * [cite\_start]**[MUST] AI Service Core Metrics Collection**: The platform's monitoring system must be able to automatically discover and collect AI application metrics that follow a standard format (e.g., Prometheus), ensuring effective monitoring of key performance indicators (e.g., latency, throughput) for model training and inference services[cite: 63].
  * [cite\_start]**[SHOULD] End-to-End Tracing**: The platform should support OpenTelemetry to enable tracing of the entire "plan-act-tool\_call-inference" chain of an agent for troubleshooting and performance analysis[cite: 55, 56].

## **4. Certification Process and Tooling**

1.  **Initial Phase (Q4 2025)**: The certification will start with a **self-assessment checklist (see Appendix A)**. Vendors will be required to complete and publicly share their platform's support for each specification item.
2.  **Maturity Phase (2026)**: An **automated conformance test suite (`sonobuoy` plugin)** will be developed and open-sourced. This suite will deploy a series of test workloads to the target cluster to automatically verify compliance by asserting platform behavior and exposed capabilities.
3.  **Introduction of Benchmarking**: The test suite will include a minimal **regression testing pipeline (see Appendix B)** with placeholders for running open-source agent benchmarks (e.g., WebArena, AgentBench) to validate the platform's functionality and performance in realistic scenarios.

```

**Architecture Interpretation**: Hardware resources are understood and scheduled by the platform layer through the core **DRA** component. The platform layer utilizes core capabilities like the **Scheduler** and **Gateway API** to provide a standardized runtime environment for the AI applications above. **Security** and **Observability** are built-in capabilities that provide end-to-end guarantees for the stable and secure operation of AI applications.
